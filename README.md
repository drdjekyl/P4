I really like this project about buiding dataset available on Seattle city website. 

The aim was to predict GHG emissions and energy consumption with simple features such as square meters or neighborhood.
To do this, I benchmark some ML models: random forest, xgboost, linear regression, lasso, ridge, svr, elastic, gradient boosting and ridge kernel.

Results was quite good with RÂ²=0.93 for the best model.
